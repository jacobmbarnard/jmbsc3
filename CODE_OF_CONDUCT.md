# The Jacob M. Barnard System Contributor Code of Conduct

*Code of Conduct Version: 1.0.1*

## Professional, Not Personal

A System Contributor is expected to participate in a manner devoid of interpersonal drama, vendetta, agenda, subterfuge, and the like. At all times, System Contributors shall conduct themselves professionally, seeking to achieve the goal of the Project: improve the System software itself. Any interpersonal issues must be addressed in ways other than forums, chats, emails, tracking tools, etc. used to communicate about the development of the System.

## Higher Commitments

While the vision for and production of the System is good, System Contributors are expected to acknowledge higher commitments, such as those pertaining to family, friends, government and so on. At no time shall contributions/work toward the System take precedence over higher commitments in life.

## Team Fluidity

In keeping with the acknowledgment of higher commitments, it is likely that some System Contributors may only participate as a System Contributor for a brief season, then leave - for a short time, long time or permanently. Contributions should be well-scoped, and progress should be well-marked, so that other System Contributors can pick up where another System Contributors left off.

## Clarity

Communication and collaboration among System Contributors to the System Contributor are expected to be clear, accurate and precise insofar as is possible.

## Appositeness

Features and improvements should be pertinent and appropriate to the goals of the System. Bringing an agenda to digress, derail or otherwise disrupt progress of System development, testing, etc. is not acceptable.

## Diversity of Thought and Idea

Variation is a crucial aspect for the vitality, nimbleness, agility and adaptability of the System. Thoughts and ideas which meet appositeness criteria for the System should be considered, no matter how new or different.

## Crystallization of Fundaments

Locking fundamental features into place is just as crucial as being open to various new ideas. Where features of the System represent a "core" of functionality, System Contributors shall be expected to guard and preserve those features, minimizing or eliminating disruption to them. A stable bedrock of core features is the best foundation for additional and diverse new layers of functionality.

## Adherence to the Correspondence Theory of Reality

System Contributors are expected to adhere to the correspondence theory of reality (i.e. use terms that signify/correspond to something in reality). Referring to a particular object or action using a term which does not describe or allow others to readily identify said object or action leads to confusion and disruption.

  - e.g. referring to `[]` as empty square brackets satisfies the correspondence theory of reality
  - e.g. referring to `{}` as an underscore *does not* satisfy the correspondence theory of reality


## Quality Over Speed

Contributions to System Contributor should be highly relevant, pertinent, easily understood, testable, etc. These goals are not quickly achieved. A measured, steady approach to development is favored over a rushed, sloppy approach.

## Quality over Quantity

Contributions to the System should be concise and elegant.

  - e.g. use of an abstract class, protocol or other higher-order programming convention is to be desired over repetitive, non-DRY lower-layer object, functional, etc. programming techniques

  - e.g. where one intuitive, simple feature can stand in the place of multiple, fragmented features, the one is to be desired over the others

## Conflict Resolution

Interpersonal conflicts are to be resolved outside of working on the System. See [Professional, Not Personal](#professional-not-personal).

Professional conflicts must be resolved by orderly, cordial, and open discussion with other System Contributors (e.g. which feature is the more pertinent, advantageous, etc.?).

Discussions which move into one or more areas of personal conflict do not conform to this Code of Conduct. System Contributors shall make every effort to close, remove, etc. such discussions from discourse.

Any System Contributor who violates this section of the Code of Conduct is subject losing System Contributor privileges.

## Accreditation

Recognition, lauds, etc. are reserved for those who have completed work, submitted ideas, etc. regarding a particular feature, bug fix, etc. Contributors are expected to not steal credit from others.
