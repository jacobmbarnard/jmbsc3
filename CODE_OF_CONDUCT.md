## Code of Conduct

### Professional

Every [System Contributor](#system-contributor) is expected to participate in a manner devoid of interpersonal drama, vendetta, agenda, subterfuge, artifice, trickery, and the like. At all times, a [System Contributor](#system-contributor) shall conduct oneself professionally, seeking to achieve the goal(s) of [The System Project](#the-project). All interpersonal issues must be addressed *without* the use of a [System Contributor Account](#system-contributor-account).

### Balance

Every [System Contributor](#system-contributor) is expected to acknowledge higher commitments: family, friends, government, and so on. At no time shall [contributions](#contribution) take precedence over higher commitments in life.

### Agility

In keeping with [Balance](#balance), it is possible that a given [System Contributor](#system-contributor) may only make a number of [contributions](#contribution) or participate for a season, then leave for a short time, long time, or permanently. [Contributions](#contribution) should be well-scoped, and progress should be well-marked, so that other [System Contributors](#system-contributor) can continue the effort.

### Reality

Referring to a particular object or action by using a term which does *not* describe or allow others to readily identify said object or action leads to confusion and disruption. Therefore, each [System Contributor](#system-contributor) is expected to adhere to the *Correspondence Theory of Reality* (i.e. use terms that signify/correspond to something in reality).

  - e.g. referring to `[]` as empty square brackets satisfies the correspondence theory of reality
  - e.g. referring to `{}` as an underscore *does not* satisfy the correspondence theory of reality

### Clarity

Communication and collaboration among [System Contributors](#system-contributor) are expected to be clear, accurate, and precise. Use basic vocabulary where possible, stay on topic, and provide access to details.

### Relevance

[Contributions](#contribution) should be pertinent and appropriate to the goals of [The System](#the-system). Bringing an agenda to digress, derail, or otherwise disrupt progress of [The System Project](#the-system-project) is unacceptable.

### Foundation-Oriented

Solidifying fundamental features is just as crucial as being open to various new ideas. Where features of [The System](#the-system) represent *core* functionality, each [System Contributor](#system-contributor) shall be expected to guard and preserve said features to minimize or eliminate disruption to [The System](#the-system). A stable bedrock of core features is the best platform for additional, diverse, new layers of functionality.

### Innovation-Welcoming

Variation is a crucial aspect for the vitality, nimbleness, agility, and adaptability of [The System](#the-system). Thoughts and ideas which meet [Relevance](#relevance) and [Foundation-Oriented](#foundation-oriented) criteria for [The System](#the-system) should be considered, no matter how new or diverse.

### Measured

A steady, thoughtful approach to making [contributions](#contribution) is favored over a rushed, sloppy approach. [Contributions](#contribution) made in such a manner usually yield more easily understood, testable, buildable, and durable results.

### Selective

[Contributions](#contribution) to [The System](#the-system) should be concise and elegant.

  - e.g. use of an abstract class, protocol or other higher-order programming convention is to be desired over repetitive, non-DRY lower-layer object, functional, etc. programming techniques

  - e.g. where one intuitive, simple feature can stand in the place of multiple, fragmented features, the one is to be desired over the others

### Conflict Resolution

Interpersonal conflicts are to be resolved outside of working on [The System](#the-system). See [Professional](#professional).

Professional conflicts must be resolved by orderly, cordial, and open discussion among each [System Contributor](#system-contributor) of concern/under consideration/in question.

Expression by any [System Contributor Account](#system-contributor-account) which moves into one or more areas of personal conflict does *not* adhere to this Code of Conduct. Any [System Contributor](#system-contributor) involved in said expression shall make reasonable effort to move, remove, or otherwise prevent such expressions from [The System Project](#the-system-project).

Any [System Contributor](#system-contributor) who violates this section of the Code of Conduct is subject losing status as a [System Contributor](#system-contributor).

### Crediting

Each [System Contributor](#system-contributor) is expected to *not steal* credit from others, and to cite, reference, or otherwise credit other [contributors](#system-contributor) as fits the situation.
